An operator is defined as $\hat{O}$ throughout. Unless otherwise specified the number of particles is
always $N$ and $d$ is the dimension of the system.  In nuclear physics
we normally define the total number of particles to be $A=N+Z$, where
$N$ is total number of neutrons and $Z$ the total number of
protons. In case of other baryons such isobars $\Delta$ or various
hyperons such as $\Lambda$ or $\Sigma$, one needs to add their
definitions.  Hereafter, $N$ is reserved for the total number of
particles, unless otherwise specificied.

The quantum numbers of a single-particle state in coordinate space are
defined by the variable 
!bt
\[
x=({\bf r},\sigma), 
\]
!et
where 
!bt
\[
{\bf r}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{d},
\]
!et
with $d=1,2,3$ represents the spatial coordinates and $\sigma$ is the eigenspin of the particle. For fermions with eigenspin $1/2$ this means that
!bt
\[
 x\in {\mathbb{R}}^{d}\oplus (\frac{1}{2}),
\]
!et
and the integral $\int dx = \sum_{\sigma}\int d^dr = \sum_{\sigma}\int d{\bf r}$,
and
!bt
\[
\int d^Nx= \int dx_1\int dx_2\dots\int dx_N.

The quantum mechanical wave function of a given state with quantum numbers $\lambda$ (encompassing all quantum numbers needed to specify the system), ignoring time, is
!bt
\[
\Psi_{\lambda}=\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N),
\]
!et
with $x_i=({\bf r}_i,\sigma_i)$ and the projection of $\sigma_i$ takes the values
$\{-1/2,+1/2\}$ for particles with spin $1/2$. 
We will hereafter always refer to $\Psi_{\lambda}$ as the exact wave function, and if the ground state is not degenerate we label it as 
!bt
\[
\Psi_0=\Psi_0(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N).
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Definitions =====
!bblock
Since the solution $\Psi_{\lambda}$ seldomly can be found in closed form, approximations are sought. Here we define an approximative wave function or an ansatz to the exact wave function as 
!bt
\[
\Phi_{\lambda}=\Phi_{\lambda}(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N),
\]
!et
with
!bt 
\[
\Phi_0=\Phi_0(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N),
\]
!et
being the ansatz to the ground state.

The wave function $\Psi_{\lambda}$ is sought in the Hilbert space of either symmetric or anti-symmetric $N$-body functions, namely
!bt
\[
\Psi_{\lambda}\in {\cal H}_N:= {\cal H}_1\oplus{\cal H}_1\oplus\dots\oplus{\cal H}_1,
\]
!et
where the single-particle Hilbert space $\hat{H}_1$ is the space of square integrable functions over
$\in {\mathbb{R}}^{d}\oplus (\sigma)$
resulting in
!bt
\[
{\cal H}_1:= L^2(\mathbb{R}^{d}\oplus (\sigma)).

Our Hamiltonian is invariant under the permutation (interchange) of two particles.
Since we deal with fermions however, the total wave function is antisymmetric.
Let $\hat{P}$ be an operator which interchanges two particles.
Due to the symmetries we have ascribed to our Hamiltonian, this operator commutes with the total Hamiltonian,
!bt
\[
[\hat{H},\hat{P}] = 0,
\]
!et
meaning that $\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_N)$ is an eigenfunction of 
$\hat{P}$ as well, that is
!bt
\[
\hat{P}_{ij}\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_N)=
\beta\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_j,\dots,x_i,\dots,x_N),
\]
!et
where $\beta$ is the eigenvalue of $\hat{P}$. We have introduced the suffix $ij$ in order to indicate that we permute particles $i$ and $j$.
The Pauli principle tells us that the total wave function for a system of fermions
has to be antisymmetric, resulting in the eigenvalue $\beta = -1$.

===== Definitions and notations =====

The Schrodinger equation reads 
!bt
\begin{equation}
\hat{H}(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_N) \Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_N) = 
E_\lambda  \Psi_\lambda(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_N), label{eq:basicSE1}
\end{equation}
!et
where the vector $x_i$ represents the coordinates (spatial and spin) of particle $i$, $\lambda$ stands  for all the quantum
numbers needed to classify a given $N$-particle state and $\Psi_{\lambda}$ is the pertaining eigenfunction.  Throughout this course,
$\Psi$ refers to the exact eigenfunction, unless otherwise stated.

===== Definitions and notations =====

We write the Hamilton operator, or Hamiltonian,  in a generic way 
!bt
\[
	\hat{H} = \hat{T} + \hat{V} 
\]
!et
where $\hat{T}$  represents the kinetic energy of the system
!bt
\[
	\hat{T} = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\mathbf{p}_i^2}{2m_i} = \sum_{i=1}^N \left( -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_i} \mathbf{\nabla_i}^2 \right) =
		\sum_{i=1}^N t(x_i)
\]
!et
while the operator $\hat{V}$ for the potential energy is given by
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\hat{V} = \sum_{i=1}^N \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i) + \sum_{j < i=1}^N v(x_i,x_j)+\sum_{i< j < k=1}^Nv(x_i,x_j,x_k)+\dots
label{eq:firstv}
\end{equation}
!et
Hereafter we use natural units, viz.~$\hbar=c=e=1$, with $e$ the elementary charge and $c$ the speed of light. This means that momenta and masses
have dimension energy.

If one does quantum chemistry, after having introduced the  Born-Oppenheimer approximation which effectively freezes out the nucleonic degrees of freedom, the Hamiltonian for $N=n_e$ electrons takes the following form 
!bt 
\[
  \hat{H} = \sum_{i=1}^{n_e} t(x_i) - \sum_{i=1}^{n_e} k\frac{Z}{r_i} + \sum_{i < j}^{n_e} \frac{k}{r_{ij}},
\]
!et
with $k=1.44$ eVnm
!eblock


!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
We can rewrite this as
!bt
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_I 
    = \sum_{i=1}^{n_e}\hat{h}_0(x_i) + \sum_{i < j}^{n_e}\frac{1}{r_{ij}},
label{H1H2}
\end{equation}
!et
where  we have defined 
!bt
\[
r_{ij}=| {\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j|,
\]
!et
 and
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \hat{h}_0(x_i) =  \hat{t}(x_i) - \frac{Z}{x_i}.
label{hi}
\end{equation}
!et
The first term of Eq.~(ref{H1H2}), $H_0$, is the sum of the $N$
*one-body* Hamiltonians $\hat{h}_0$. Each individual
Hamiltonian $\hat{h}_0$ contains the kinetic energy operator of an
electron and its potential energy due to the attraction of the
nucleus. The second term, $H_I$, is the sum of the $n_e(n_e-1)/2$
two-body interactions between each pair of electrons. Note that the double sum carries a restriction $i < j$.
!eblock


!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
The potential energy term due to the attraction of the nucleus defines the onebody field $u_i=u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ of Eq.~(ref{eq:firstv}).
We have moved this term into the $\hat{H}_0$ part of the Hamiltonian, instead of keeping  it in $\hat{V}$ as in  Eq.~(ref{eq:firstv}).
The reason is that we will hereafter treat $\hat{H}_0$ as our non-interacting  Hamiltonian. For a many-body wavefunction $\Phi_{\lambda}$ defined by an  
appropriate single-particle basis, we may solve exactly the non-interacting eigenvalue problem 
!bt 
\[
\hat{H}_0\Phi_{\lambda}= w_{\lambda}\Phi_{\lambda},
\]
!et
with $w_{\lambda}$ being the non-interacting energy. This energy is defined by the sum over single-particle energies to be defined below.
For atoms the single-particle energies could be the hydrogen-like single-particle energies corrected for the charge $Z$. For nuclei and quantum
dots, these energies could be given by the harmonic oscillator in three and two dimensions, respectively.
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
We will assume that the interacting part of the Hamiltonian
can be approximated by a two-body interaction.
This means that our Hamiltonian is written as 
!bt
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_I 
    = \sum_{i=1}^N \hat{h}_0(x_i) + \sum_{i < j}^N V(r_{ij}),
label{Hnuclei}
\end{equation}
!et
with 
!bt
\begin{equation}
  H_0=\sum_{i=1}^N \hat{h}_0(x_i) =  \sum_{i=1}^N\left(\hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)\right).
label{hinuclei}
\end{equation}
!et
The onebody part $u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ is normally approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential or the Coulomb interaction an electron feels from the nucleus. However, other potentials are fully possible, such as 
one derived from the self-consistent solution of the Hartree-Fock equations.

Since we deal with fermions however, the total wave function is antisymmetric.
Let $\hat{P}$ be an operator which interchanges two particles.
Due to the symmetries we have ascribed to our Hamiltonian, this operator commutes with the total Hamiltonian,
!bt

$\hat{P}$ as well, that is

\[
\hat{P}_{ij}\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_N)=
\beta\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_N),
\]
!et
where $\beta$ is the eigenvalue of $\hat{P}$. We have introduced the suffix $ij$ in order to indicate that we permute particles $i$ and $j$.
The Pauli principle tells us that the total wave function for a system of fermions
has to be antisymmetric, resulting in the eigenvalue $\beta = -1$.

In our case we assume that  we can approximate the exact eigenfunction with a Slater determinant
!bt
\begin{equation}
   \Phi(x_1, x_2,\dots ,x_N,\alpha,\beta,\dots, \sigma)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}
\left| \begin{array}{ccccc} \psi_{\alpha}(x_1)& \psi_{\alpha}(x_2)& \dots & \dots & \psi_{\alpha}(x_N)\\
                            \psi_{\beta}(x_1)&\psi_{\beta}(x_2)& \dots & \dots & \psi_{\beta}(x_N)\\

                            \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
                     \psi_{\sigma}(x_1)&\psi_{\sigma}(x_2)& \dots & \dots & \psi_{\sigma}(x_N)\end{array} \right|, label{eq:HartreeFockDet}
\end{equation}
!et
where  $x_i$  stand for the coordinates and spin values of a particle $i$ and $\alpha,\beta,\dots, \gamma$ 
are quantum numbers needed to describe remaining quantum numbers.

===== Definitions and notations =====

The single-particle function $\psi_{\alpha}(x_i)$  are eigenfunctions of the onebody
Hamiltonian $h_i$, that is
!bt 
\[
\hat{h}_0(x_i)=\hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i),
\]
!et
with eigenvalues 
!bt 
\[
\hat{h}_0(x_i) \psi_{\alpha}(x_i)=\left(\hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)\right)\psi_{\alpha}(x_i)=\varepsilon_{\alpha}\psi_{\alpha}(x_i).
\]
!et
The energies $\varepsilon_{\alpha}$ are the so-called non-interacting single-particle energies, or unperturbed energies. 
The total energy is in this case the sum over all  single-particle energies, if no two-body or more complicated
many-body interactions are present.

===== Definitions and notations =====

Let us denote the ground state energy by $E_0$. According to the
variational principle we have
!bt
\[
  E_0 \le E[\Phi] = \int \Phi^*\hat{H}\Phi d\mathbf{\tau}
\]
!et
where $\Phi$ is a trial function which we assume to be normalized
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} = 1,
\]
!et
where we have used the shorthand $d\mathbf{\tau}=d\mathbf{r}_1d\mathbf{r}_2\dots d\mathbf{r}_N$.

===== Brief reminder on some linear algebra properties =====
!bblock
Before we proceed with a more compact representation of a Slater determinant, we would like to repeat some linear algebra properties which will be useful for our derivations of the energy as function of a Slater determinant, Hartree-Fock theory and later the nuclear shell model.

The inverse of a matrix is defined by

!bt
\[
\mathbf{A}^{-1} \cdot \mathbf{A} = I
\]
!et
A unitary matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is one whose inverse is its adjoint
!bt
\[
\mathbf{A}^{-1}=\mathbf{A}^{\dagger}
\]
!et
A real unitary matrix is called orthogonal and its inverse is equal to its transpose.
A hermitian matrix is its own self-adjoint, that  is
!bt
\[
\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{A}^{\dagger}.

===== Basic Matrix Features =====
!bblock
Since we will deal with Fermions (identical and indistinguishable particles) we will 
form an ansatz for a given state in terms of so-called Slater determinants determined
by a chosen basis of single-particle functions. 

For a given $n\times n$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$ we can write its determinant
!bt
\[
   det(\mathbf{A})=|\mathbf{A}|=
\left| \begin{array}{ccccc} a_{11}& a_{12}& \dots & \dots & a_{1n}\\
                            a_{21}&a_{22}& \dots & \dots & a_{2n}\\  
                            \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
                            \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
                            a_{n1}& a_{n2}& \dots & \dots & a_{nn}\end{array} \right|,
\]
!et
in a more compact form as 
!bt
\[
|\mathbf{A}|= \sum_{i=1}^{n!}(-1)^{p_i}\hat{P}_i a_{11}a_{22}\dots a_{nn},
\]
!et
where $\hat{P}_i$ is a permutation operator which permutes the column indices $1,2,3,\dots,n$
and the sum runs over all $n!$ permutations.  The quantity $p_i$ represents the number of transpositions of column indices that are needed in order to bring a given permutation back to its initial ordering, in our case given by $a_{11}a_{22}\dots a_{nn}$ here.

===== Basic Matrix Features, simple $2 \times 2$ determinant  =====
!bblock
A simple $2\times 2$ determinant illustrates this. We have
!bt
\[
   det(\mathbf{A})=
\left| \begin{array}{cc} a_{11}& a_{12}\\
                            a_{21}&a_{22}\end{array} \right|= (-1)^0a_{11}a_{22}+(-1)^1a_{12}a_{21},
\]
!et
where in the last term we have interchanged the column indices $1$ and $2$. The natural ordering we have chosen is $a_{11}a_{22}$. 
!eblock



!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
With the above we can rewrite our Slater determinant in a more compact form.
In the Hartree-Fock method the trial function is the Slater
determinant of Eq.~(ref{eq:HartreeFockDet}) which can be rewritten as 
!bt
\[
  \Phi(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N,\alpha,\beta,\dots,\nu) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}\sum_{P} (-)^P\hat{P}\psi_{\alpha}(x_1)
    \psi_{\beta}(x_2)\dots\psi_{\nu}(x_N)=\sqrt{N!}\hat{A}\Phi_H,
\]
!et
where we have introduced the antisymmetrization operator $\hat{A}$ defined by the 
summation over all possible permutations of two particles.
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
It is defined as
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \hat{A} = \frac{1}{N!}\sum_{p} (-)^p\hat{P},
label{antiSymmetryOperator}
\end{equation}
!et
with $p$ standing for the number of permutations. We have introduced for later use the so-called
Hartree-function, defined by the simple product of all possible single-particle functions
!bt
\[
  \Phi_H(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N,\alpha,\beta,\dots,\nu) =
  \psi_{\alpha}(x_1)
    \psi_{\beta}(x_2)\dots\psi_{\nu}(x_N).
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
Both $\hat{H}_0$ and $\hat{H}_I$ are invariant under all possible permutations of any two particles
and hence commute with $\hat{A}$
!bt
\begin{equation}
  [H_0,\hat{A}] = [H_I,\hat{A}] = 0. label{commutionAntiSym}
\end{equation}
!et
Furthermore, $\hat{A}$ satisfies
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \hat{A}^2 = \hat{A},  label{AntiSymSquared}
\end{equation}
!et
since every permutation of the Slater
determinant reproduces it. 
!eblock

===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
The expectation value of $\hat{H}_0$ 
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = N! \int \Phi_H^*\hat{A}\hat{H}_0\hat{A}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau}
\]
!et
is readily reduced to
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = N! \int \Phi_H^*\hat{H}_0\hat{A}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau},
\]
!et
where we have used Eqs.~(ref{commutionAntiSym}) and
(ref{AntiSymSquared}). The next step is to replace the antisymmetrization
operator by its definition and to
replace $\hat{H}_0$ with the sum of one-body operators
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}
  = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{p} (-)^p\int 
  \Phi_H^*\hat{h}_0\hat{P}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau}.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
The integral vanishes if two or more particles are permuted in only one
of the Hartree-functions $\Phi_H$ because the individual single-particle wave functions are
orthogonal. We obtain then
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}= \sum_{i=1}^N \int \Phi_H^*\hat{h}_0\Phi_H  d\mathbf{\tau}.
\]
!et
Orthogonality of the single-particle functions allows us to further simplify the integral, and we
arrive at the following expression for the expectation values of the
sum of one-body Hamiltonians 
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}
  = \sum_{\mu=1}^N \int \psi_{\mu}^*(\mathbf{r})\hat{h}_0\psi_{\mu}(\mathbf{r})
  d\mathbf{r}.
  label{H1Expectation}
\end{equation}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
We introduce the following shorthand for the above integral
!bt
\[
\langle \mu | \hat{h}_0 | \mu \rangle = \int \psi_{\mu}^*(\mathbf{r})\hat{h}_0\psi_{\mu}(\mathbf{r})  d\mathbf{r},
\]
!et
and rewrite Eq.~(ref{H1Expectation}) as
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}
  = \sum_{\mu=1}^N \langle \mu | \hat{h}_0 | \mu \rangle.
  label{H1Expectation1}
\end{equation}

===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
The expectation value of the two-body part of the Hamiltonian is obtained in a
similar manner. We have
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_I\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = N! \int \Phi_H^*\hat{A}\hat{H}_I\hat{A}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau},
\]
!et
which reduces to
!bt
\[
 \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_I\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = \sum_{i\le j=1}^N \sum_{p} (-)^p\int 
  \Phi_H^*V(r_{ij})\hat{P}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau},
\]
!et
by following the same arguments as for the one-body
Hamiltonian. 
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
Because of the dependence on the inter-particle distance $r_{ij}$,  permutations of
any two particles no longer vanish, and we get
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_I\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = \sum_{i < j=1}^N \int  
  \Phi_H^*V(r_{ij})(1-P_{ij})\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau}.
\]
!et
where $P_{ij}$ is the permutation operator that interchanges
particle $i$ and particle $j$. Again we use the assumption that the single-particle wave functions
are orthogonal.

The first term is the so-called direct term. It is frequently also called the  Hartree term, 
while the second is due to the Pauli principle and is called
the exchange term or just the Fock term.
The factor  $1/2$ is introduced because we now run over
all pairs twice.

We consider a system of electrons confined in a pure isotropic harmonic oscillator potential $V(\mathbf{r})=m^* \omega_0^2 r^2/2$, where $m^*$ is the effective mass of the electrons in the host semiconductor, $\omega_0$ is the oscillator frequency of the confining potential, and $\mathbf{r}=(x,y,z)$ denotes the position of the particle.

The Hamiltonian of a single particle trapped in this harmonic oscillator potential simply reads

When considering several particles trapped in the same quantum dot, the Coulomb repulsion between those electrons has to be added to the single particle Hamiltonian which gives

In coordinate space, $\mathbf{p}_i$ is the operator $-i \hbar \nabla_i$ and by applying the Hamiltonian on the total wave function $\Psi(\mathbf{r})$ in the Schroedinger equation, we obtain the following operator acting on $\Psi(\mathbf{r})$

\begin{align}
\mathbf{A}\cdot \mathbf{p_i}+\mathbf{p_i}\cdot \mathbf{A} &= - i \hbar \left( \mathbf{A}\cdot \nabla_i+\nabla_i\cdot \mathbf{A} \right) \Psi \\

We note that if we use the product rule and the Coulomb gauge $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} = 0$ (by choosing the vector potential as $\mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{r}$), $\mathbf{p_i}$ and $\nabla_i$ commute and we obtain

\[
 \nabla_i \cdot (\mathbf{A}\Psi) = \mathbf{A} \cdot (\nabla_i\Psi) + (\underbrace{\nabla_i \cdot \mathbf{A})}_0 \Psi=\mathbf{A} \cdot (\nabla_i\Psi)

&= \frac{ e}{2m^*} \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{L} 
\end{align}
!et
where $\mathbf{L}=-i \hbar (\mathbf{r_i} \times \nabla_i)$ is the orbital angular momentum operator of the electron $i$.

If we assume that the electrons are confined in the $xy$-plane, the quadratic term in $\mathbf{A}$ can be written as
!bt
\[
\frac{e^2}{2m^*} \mathbf{A}^2 = \frac{e^2}{8m^*} (\mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{r})^2

Until this point we have neglected the intrinsic magnetic moment of the electrons which is due to the electron spin in the host material. We will now add its effect to the Hamiltonian. This intrinsic magnetic moment is given by 
!bt
\[
M_s=-g_s (e \mathbf{S})/(2m), 
\]

where $g_s$ is the effective spin gyromagnetic ratio.


We see that the spin magnetic moment $M_s$ gives rise to an additional interaction energy linear in the magnetic field,
!bt
\[
  \hat{H}_s= - M_s \cdot \mathbf{B} = g_s \frac{e}{2 m} B \hat{S}_z= g_s \frac{\omega_c}{2} \hat{S}_z

In order to simplify the computation, the Hamiltonian can be rewritten on dimensionless form.
For this purpose, we introduce the following constants:
* The oscillator frequency $\omega = \omega_0\sqrt{1+\omega_c^2/ (4\omega_0^2)}$,
* A new energy unit $\hbar \omega$,
* A new length unit, the oscillator length defined by $l=\sqrt{\hbar /(m^* \omega)}$, also called the characteristic length unit.

We rewrite the Hamiltonian in dimensionless units using
$$\mathbf{r} \longrightarrow \frac{\mathbf{r}}{l}, \quad \nabla \longrightarrow l \;\nabla \quad \text{and} \quad \hat{L}_z \longrightarrow \hat{L}_z$$

A new dimensionless parameter $\lambda=l / a_0^*$ (where $a_0^*= 4 \pi \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r \hbar^2 / (e^2 m^*)$ is the effective Bohr radius) describes the strength of the electron-electron interaction.
Large $\lambda$ implies strong interaction and/or large quantum dot.

Since both $\hat{L_z}$ and $\hat{S_z}$ commute with the Hamiltonian we can perform the calculations separately in subspaces of given quantum numbers $L_z$ and $S_z$.

The simplified dimensionless Hamiltonian becomes
!bt
\[
  \hat{H}=\sum_{i=1}^{N_e} \left[  -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 + \frac{1}{2} r_i^2  \right]+ \lambda \sum_{i < j}\frac{1}{r_{ij}} +  \sum_{i=1}^{N_e} \left(  \frac{1}{2}  \frac{\omega_c}{\hbar \omega} L_z^{(i)}+ \frac{1  }{2} g_s^* \frac{\omega_c}{\hbar \omega} S_z^{(i)}\right),

The last sum which is proportional to the magnetic field involves only the quantum numbers $L_z$ and $S_z$ and not the operators themselves. Therefore these terms can be put aside during the resolution, the squizzing effect of the magnetic field being included simply in the parameter $\lambda$. The contribution of these terms will be added when the other part has been solved. This brings us to the simple and general form of the Hamiltonian
!bt
\[
\hat{H}=\sum_{i=1}^{N_e} \left(  -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 + \frac{1}{2} r_i^2  \right)+ \lambda \sum_{i < j}\frac{1}{r_{ij}}.

\[
\hat{H}=\sum_{i=1}^{N_e} \left(  -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 + \frac{1}{2} r_i^2  \right)+ \lambda \sum_{i < j}\frac{1}{r_{ij}},
