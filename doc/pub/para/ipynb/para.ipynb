      "\n",
      "* SIMD (single-instruction-multiple-data) machines incorporate the idea of parallel processing, which use a large number of processing units to execute the same instruction on different data.\n",

      "\n",
      "* One way of categorizing modern parallel computers is to look at the memory configuration.\n",

      "\n",
      "* **Task parallelism**:  the work of a global problem can be divided into a number of independent tasks, which rarely need to synchronize.  Monte Carlo simulation is one example. Integration is another. However this paradigm is of limited use.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Data parallelism**:  use of multiple threads (e.g. one thread per processor) to dissect loops over arrays etc.  This paradigm requires a single memory address space.  Communication and synchronization between processors are often hidden, thus easy to program. However, the user surrenders much control to a specialized compiler. Examples of data parallelism are compiler-based parallelization and OpenMP directives.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Different parallel programming paradigms\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Message passing**:  all involved processors have an independent memory address space. The user is responsible for  partitioning the data/work of a global problem and distributing the  subproblems to the processors. Collaboration between processors is achieved by explicit message passing, which is used for data transfer plus synchronization.\n",
      "\n",
      "* This paradigm is the most general one where the user has full control. Better parallel efficiency is usually achieved by explicit message passing. However, message-passing programming is more difficult.\n",

      "### SPMD (single-program-multiple-data)\n",
      "\n",
      "Although message-passing programming supports MIMD, it \n",

      "* Same executable for all the processors.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Each processor works primarily with its assigned local data.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Today's situation of parallel computing\n",
      "\n",
      "* Distributed memory is the dominant hardware configuration. There is a large diversity in these machines, from  MPP (massively parallel processing) systems to clusters of off-the-shelf PCs, which are very cost-effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Message-passing is a mature programming paradigm and widely accepted. It often provides an efficient match to the hardware. It is primarily used for the distributed memory systems, but can also be used on shared memory systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Modern nodes have nowadays several cores, which makes it interesting to use both shared memory (the given node) and distributed memory (several nodes with communication). This leads often to codes which use both MPI and OpenMP.\n",
