\frametitle{The Metropolis algorithm}

\begin{block}{}
The Metropolis method is simply the power method for computing the
right eigenvector of $M$ with the largest magnitude eigenvalue.
By construction, the correct probability distribution is a right eigenvector
with eigenvalue 1. Therefore, for the Metropolis method to converge
to this result, we must show that $M$ has only one eigenvalue with this
magnitude, and all other eigenvalues are smaller.
